<h1>Webpage on ID assignment 2 (by Ng Tung Xuan)</h1>
<h2>Motive of this website:</h2> 
<p>To allow Users in Singapore to get information regarding Covid-19 and stay updated on the conditions of 
other countries affected by covid-19 as well as Singapore. This is to help users extract more information more easily for example, the
daily cases or total cases of covid-19 cases in Singapore or other countries and how to protect themselves against covid-19 as well.<p>

<h2>Features of this website:</h2>
<p>Users can find and extract covid-19 data such as the total amount of cases or deaths of a particular country, or a particular continent, or they can choose to compare the data
between two countries. There is also another feature which allows users to share their comments or give good advice to other users on how to better prepare and combat against the covid-19 virus.</p>

<h2>Design Process:</h2>
<h4>This Website is made to allow users in Singapore or other users from other countries to be able to access Covid-19 data easily. For example if users want to find out about the total amount of cases around the world, the amount of deaths of a particular country, or a continent, they can do so easily by just entering the country or continent they want in the search bar and the results will be shown. This idea came to me as we are now in this difficult period where covid-19 has affected most of the people around the world, hence I think that it is important for people to be prepared information wise so that they can protect themselves effectively against covid-19. Another motive of this website is also to allow users to find out more about covid-19. For example ways to protect themselves or the measures put in place in Singapore against covid-19. I also decided to add a new feature to the website that allows users to share their comments or advices on covid-19 by creating a local storage to store the user comments then displaying it so that other users can also see it.</h4>
  

<h2>Test cases</h2>
1. For the Selecting Multiple countries feature, users must select 2 countries, not less, not more or else the results will not be shown
