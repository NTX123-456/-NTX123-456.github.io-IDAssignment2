<h2>Design Process</h2>
<h3>This Website is made to allow users in Singapore or other users from other countries to be able to access Covid-19 data easily. For example if users want to find out about the total amount of cases around the world, the amount of deaths of a particular country, or a continent, they can do so easily by just entering the country or continent they want in the search bar and the results will be shown. This idea came to me as we are now in this difficult period where covid-19 has affected most of the people around the world, hence I think that it is important for people to be prepared to protect themselves against covid-19. Another motive of this website is also to allow users to find out more about covid-19. For example ways to protect themselves or the measures put in place in Singapore against covid-19.</h3>
